Allow disabling full site editing in the admin, useful to protect a production site.

== Description ==

Allow disabling full site editing in the admin, useful to protect a production site.
A block theme will continue to work as intended on the frontend while making sure the theme can't be messed up.

> *⚠️ Full site editing is still fresh.*
For the coming months I'll keep testing the plugin with new (beta) releases of gutenberg and WordPres.

== Installation ==

Just install the plugin and activate.
There is an admin settings page or set the `DISABLE_FSE` constant.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= In what order does the plugin check if full site editing is allowed? =

1. The constant `DISABLE_FSE` set to true/false.
   You can add the constant in your `wp-config.php` file.
2. The setting in the wp-admin (a sub page of the tools menu)
3. The current `WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE`. [Docs](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_get_environment_type/), [A bit more details](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/24/new-wp_get_environment_type-function-in-wordpress-5-5/)

= How does the `DISABLE_FSE` constant work? =

In your `wp-config.php` paste the following to always disable FSE:

	define( 'DISABLE_FSE', true );

or to always enable FSE

	define( 'DISABLE_FSE', false );
